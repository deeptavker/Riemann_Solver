# Riemann_Solver

A basic implementation of a riemann solver using SPH technique. 

Read about Riemann problems [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_problem). 

To add:

- XSPH Velocity correction for particles
- Variable particle velocities support : EGN as an evolving vector field 
- More equations for simulating cases such as sod shocktube
- Generalise periodicity from [-1,1] to any arbitary domain
